# MyEditor 3.1


This is a small project of a text editor that I developed during my DAI degree in 2004. In Spanish, **_Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Inform√°ticas_**

On the 20th anniversary of its creation, I have decided to upload the repository to Github, with the purpose of adding new functionalities.

The main language of the project is Pascal and for its development I used Borland Delphi 7.

## Run project

To run the application, you will need to have the Embarcadero Delphi 11 IDE installed
